## Antonio Fregoso
Enthusiast of innovation with Python and JavaScript applied to companies. I like to develop with [Odoo 15](https://github.com/odoo/odoo), [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) and chatbots with [rasa](https://rasa.com/).

These are my public collaborations:

#### reveal.js-animate
Integration of the animation library [animate.css](https://animate.style) to [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/).
Animate the childNodes of each slide identifying them by html tag (tagName). They are written in capital letters as: H1, H2, ...., H6, TABLE, IMG, DIV, P, OL, UL etc.

3 parameters are used:
- Animation type: animated.
- Speed: speed.
- Times it is executed: repeat.
